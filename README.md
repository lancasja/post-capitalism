# Post Capitalism

Our piece [Post-capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-capitalism) explores potential outcomes of what that future might look like using the [P5.play](http://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/) [Virtual Camera](http://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/examples/index.html?fileName=camera.js) and [Sprite](http://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/examples/index.html?fileName=sprite.js) class. Players collect various resources that determine the outcome of their Post-Capitalist world.

## Development

Run `node -v` to check if you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. If not download and install it, then you might want to restart your computer.

Open a terminal and run:

1. `npm i` to install dependencies
2. `npm start:dev` to start server and load browser

The main file to edit is `index.js`.

If everything is working you'll see a green square on the screen.
